# Guidelines for Contributing

## Getting Started

We use Grunt to build and test Angular-D3 and Bower to manage dependencies. You
can get started by first cloning the repository (fork it if you want to submit
pull-requests). The follow these steps:

```sh
# Setup
npm install

# Running the demo
npm start

# Building the NPM package (output to /dist)
npm run dist
```

## Submitting A Pull Request

We don't have any strict requirements on pull requests at this point. This
policy will probably change as we approach a 1.0 version. For now we welcome
any pull requests, particularly those adding new directives for chart elements
or features.

And last but not least, thanks for contributing!
